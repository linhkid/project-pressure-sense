Sometimes, having someone who can offer additional support and resources can make a big difference.\n\nAlso, I want to recommend something for you to try: taking slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and breathe out for a count of four. Repeat this a few times, and see if it helps calm your body and mind a bit."
