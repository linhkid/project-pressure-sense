They can help find resources that factor in BOTH your needs, potentially even in-home care options or financial aid programs you're not aware of. \n2. **Debt Management:** You tried before, but let's revisit it together. There might be programs you missed, or ways to negotiate with creditors while you get back on your feet. I can help you research options tailored to your area and situation.  \n3. **Community Support:**  Are there local charities, religious groups, or even family nearby who might offer temporary assistance? Sometimes a little help can ease the immediate burden while we tackle the bigger issues. \n\nYou are not alone in this fight.
